<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The basic idea of this bot is to create a multi-purpose household bot with a lot of features which justifies its price for an average household. Most household bots today only do single things like cleaning, playing but without increasing hardware significantly (which will not increase the cost) we can add a lot of features. The bot will help in all day to day activities ranging from baby care, cleaning, security and a lot more. Many small and innovative ideas like detachable components and DIY tutorials will increase its usability and decrease cost. We will also make it modifiable and programmable by users so that they can experiment with it, learn, and add new features. 
The core idea is to  add innovative features with a limited hardware which solve small day to day problems.

This a boon for all the working parents out there who are looking for a reliable solution to their process of setting up a balance between parenting and work. We know how a parent wants the best for their child and is ready to spend any amount of money to establish an amazing future for them, but here, with our bot, we provide them with all the necessary help in the best quality while taking care of their pockets!

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
From cleaning the house to taking care of their baby by monitoring and following it, our bot is just what a working parent needs for their child. You can even video call from any remote location using our bot!

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] Built our very own bot design completely from scratch
- [x] Testing of Airflow (CFD-Computational Fluid Dynamics)
- [x] Testing of Stress analysis (FEA-Finite Element Analysis)
- [x] Implemented custom-written YoLoV3  and ResNet algorithms
- [x] Created algorithms for navigation and complete-coverage vacuuming for the bot 
- [ ] Hardware of the bot (awaiting funding for our innovative idea)


See the [open issues](https://github.com/harshmahesheka/Multi-Purpose-HouseHold-Bot/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
